<p>
This project has allowed me to gain insights into the real estate market in Bilbao and has provided valuable practice for my web scraping and API extraction skills. 
<p>
The dataset was extracted from Fotocasa and Idealista. I scraped the Fotocasa website and extracted information using the Idealista API. Scraping Fotocasa was particularly challenging due to the lack of tutorials or readily available information on the process. Regarding Idealista, I'd like to emphasize that efficiency was key. I had to preselect the specific properties I wanted to retrieve to optimize the process and minimize errors, given that the API only permits 100 requests per month, with a limit of 50 items per request.
